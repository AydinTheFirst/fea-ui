# FeaUI

A lightweight, accessible React component library built on top of [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/).

### Important Notice

FeaUI is currently in alpha. Breaking changes may occur before the stable release. Use at your own risk.

### Philosophy

> **Styles belong to styles. Logic belongs to components.**

This principle defines how Fea UI is designed and how it should be used.
