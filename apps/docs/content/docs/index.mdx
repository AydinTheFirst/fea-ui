title: Introduction
description: A lightweight, accessible React component library built on top of [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/)
---

**Fea UI** is a lightweight UI utility library built around a simple rule:

**components describe structure and behavior — styling is defined elsewhere.**

Instead of writing Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX, Fea UI maps component props to **semantic, BEM-based class names**, while all visual styles are composed inside CSS files using Tailwind’s `@apply`.
This keeps components clean, predictable, and easy to reason about as a codebase grows.

### A minimal example

**Component**

```tsx
<BaseButton className={buttonVariants({ variant: "primary", size: "sm" })} />
```

**Generated class names**

```html
<button class="button button--primary button--sm" />
```

**CSS**

```css
.button--primary {
  @apply bg-primary text-primary-foreground;
}
```

That’s it.

- No inline utilities
- No conditional class logic
- No styling inside JSX

## Philosophy

> **Styles belong to styles. Logic belongs to components.**

This principle defines how Fea UI is designed and how it should be used.
