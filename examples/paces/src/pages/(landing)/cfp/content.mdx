## Call for Papers

### 10th PACES Conference for Undergraduate Students: **“Fantasy”**

**May 11th, 2026**  
**Department of English Language and Literature**  
**Pamukkale University, Denizli**

The Department of English Language and Literature at Pamukkale University is pleased to announce the **TÜBİTAK-supported 10th PACES Conference**, a milestone celebration of a decade dedicated to fostering undergraduate scholarly excellence. This year’s conference theme is **“Fantasy.”**

For ten years, PACES has provided a unique platform for undergraduate students to engage in academic discourse, present original research, and contribute to the vibrant community of emerging scholars. As we mark this special anniversary, we invite submissions that explore the boundless realms of fantasy and the fantastic across literature, culture, and the arts.

We welcome papers that examine how fantasy disrupts, transforms, and reimagines our understanding of reality. From high fantasy and magical realism to supernatural horror and speculative worlds, the fantastic offers a space where boundaries dissolve, conventions are challenged, and alternative possibilities emerge. The conference aims to foster critical discussions on the ways fantasy functions as a mode of storytelling, cultural critique, and imaginative world-building.

PACES aspires to support undergraduate students within an academic framework, allowing them to present their research and engage in meaningful discourse on literary and cultural issues. A selection of papers presented at the conference will be published in **HALO Journal**, a publication supported by TÜBİTAK.
